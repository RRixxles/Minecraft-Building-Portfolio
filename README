Hey!
I'm Rixxles, and I've recently had the idea to document every build I do. I don't know why... but I'm doing it.

I've listed every build as a new release on the releases page. That's where you can find my newest builds. (sometimes may have a download for you to mess around with on your worlds!)
Well, what are you waiting for? Head to the releases page!

By the way, if you have any feedback, please let me know by making a new Issue. Thanks!
